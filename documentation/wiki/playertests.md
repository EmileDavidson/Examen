# PlayerTests

### UserTest 1:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/Usertest1.mp4" %}

* Controls are easy to understand
* Pre-spawned product on the ground were quite confusing
* Not clear they needed to attend the checkout area
* Not clear what to do at the checkout area
* Clear where product have to be brought to
* Visuals of the game looking good

### UserTest2:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/Usertest2.mp4" %}

* Players first had to look if they were player red or blue
* Didn’t know they had to attend to the checkout area
* Though they could only restock the shelves as a task
* Sometimes struggles with grabbing objects from the floor
* Thought they had to give the grabbed object to customers instead of restocking it in the shelf
* Wanted button prompts (didn’t know what buttons to press to interact with something)

### UserTest3:

* &#x20;Bug where the player ragdoll explodes
* More visual indications of where to go and what to do
* Not 100% clear that not helping a customer is a bad thing

### UserTest4:

* Bug where the customers get stuck in their pathfinding when walking against another customer
* Not clear where products have to brought to
* Were missing the element of working together
* Game went by fairly quickly
  * Feedback: slow the game down more so the player has more time to experiment with things.
* Customers need to walk slower so that the player has more time to experiment
* Not helping a customer didn’t give a punishing feeling
* Wasn’t that easy to grab objects
* Fun that players could grab the same object to sort of ‘fight’ over the object
* Possibly adding timer/speedrun element to the game
