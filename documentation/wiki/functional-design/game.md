(link to the player ragdoll [here](../technical-design/player/ragdoll.md)) These physics were added because the game was inspired by the games Gang Beasts and Human Fall Flat. And talking about inspirations for the game, Overcooked was a big inspiration for the game overall, such as the fun co-op stress that the game delivers.

#### Goal and Core of the Game
