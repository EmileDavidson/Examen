Players

In the game you (the player) will have to do certain tasks in order to keep your store running and keep the customers happy (to get more info about customers, click [here](customer.md)). To complete these tasks the player will need certain controls and actions to complete these tasks. The tasks the players will be executing are done using a standard controller. \[insert image of the controls]

### Tasks:

#### Movement

One of these tasks is the most important of all: player movement. The player can use the left joystick to move around in the scene to move to certain positions where other tasks have to be completed.

#### Grabbing

Another task the player has is to grab items. These items have a lot of variation. They can be the products such as apples, bananas and pizza that will need to be delivered to the correct shelf. But Those items can also be the customer. This feature was added so that one of the two players could keep a customer in place, while the other player quickly restocks a shelf so that the customer wonâ€™t get angry. There is also a box in which the products get delivered by a truck.

#### Delivering of Products

The truck being one of the other tasks, needs to be grabbed by two players before the doors will open. Once this is done the ordered products will get delivered in boxes. These boxes can be opened by pressing the interaction button. When this button is pressed the box will disappear and the correct amount of the product contained within will be spawned. But before you can actually get the boxes they will have to be ordered.

#### Ordering Products

To order products the player has to go to a certain room in where an ordering screen is located. The player can cycle through the products on this screen by pressing the shoulder buttons on the controller. Every product on this list will have their own buy and sell value, whereof the buy value will be used for ordering and the sell value will be used when a product gets sold. When the player wants to order a product they can press the interaction button to add the selected product to the ordering list. So when there are items on that list and the truck doors gets opened, the truck will dispense the items on this list in boxes and clear the list, ready for the next order.

#### Checkout

Once shelves are restocked, the customers can grab these items and bring them to the checkout area, where another important task of the player is located. Once the customer drops their product onto the conveyor belt, the player will have to grab this object and move it past the scanner to scan it. When this is done successfully the player will receive the according amount of money that the product is worth.\
