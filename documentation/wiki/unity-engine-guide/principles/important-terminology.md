# Important Terminology

## Scenes/Levels

The term 'scene' is commonly used to refer to a 'level', and these terms are often used interchangeably. The history of this term can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level\_\(video\_games\))

However, it is worth noting that we prefer to use the term 'scenes' over 'levels'.

## Variables/Properties

The terms 'variable' and 'property' are often used interchangeably, but when they are used together in the same context, there is a distinction between them.

#### property

A 'property' generally refers to a variable that is defined within a class. For instance, if the class BP\_Barrel has a variable called 'bExploded', 'bExploded' may be referred to as a property of BP\_Barrel. The term 'property' often implies accessing previously defined data within the context of a class.

#### variable

On the other hand, a 'variable' typically refers to a variable that is defined as a function argument or a local variable inside a function. When used within the context of a class, 'variable' usually conveys discussion about its definition and what it will hold.
