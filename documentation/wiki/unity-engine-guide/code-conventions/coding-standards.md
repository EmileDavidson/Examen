# Coding Standards

We have a few simple coding standards and conventions. This document is not meant to be a discussion or work in progress, but rather, reflects the state of Unity's and C#'s current coding standards. Following the coding standards is mandatory.

Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:

* 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
* Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
* Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
* If we decide to expose source code to mod community developers, we want it to be easily understood.
* Many of these conventions are actually required for cross-compiler compatibility.

The coding standards below are C#-centric, but the spirit of the standards is expected to be followed no matter which language is used. A section may provide equivalent rules or exceptions for specific languages where it's applicable.
