# Sprint 2

## Feedback of the customer:

### Positive feedback:

* The game has a lot of potential
* They are working on a prototype with this concept of their own
* Good to see how we see and think ( how we envision the game)&#x20;
* in level money that can be earned and used to proceed is a fun concept

### Improvement feedback:

* The co-op aspect of the game isn't really showing. Players can do their own things and still complete the level
* Take a look at the layout (top down view gives some elements that are not shown because other items are to big)&#x20;
* The game needs to much brain power you can't focus on everything&#x20;
* Products where dropped on the ground in the current fase of the game but this didn't make sense in there eyes so they asked why? and we sayed we will change it to a product ordering system.
* why only 2 players? wouldn't it be fun to have 4 players this makes a lot more possible and easier to play (we sayed we do 2 because of the limited time we have but more players are always an option)&#x20;
* Lack of user feedback
