# Sprint 3

Feeback customer

positive feedback: \
\- Concept is still very cool \
\- They took their own prototype to and event \
\- End screen menu is clear and feels finished \
\- The physics are fun! (that you can collide with customers and they "wiggle")\


Improvement feedback: \
\- The controls are still a bit confusing, too many buttons \
\- Controls weren't clear for the player \
\- Floor texture is quite heavy on the eyes, draws a bit too much focus \
\- UI was a bit too hidden for the players to notice \
\- Player was guessing the checkout had to be attended it wasn't clear if it was actually the case&#x20;
