# Sprint 1

## Feedback of the customer:

### Positive feedback:

* Presentation was really nice and presented well
* Theme & Concept is very relatable
* Character designs looking really good

### Improvement feedback

* Is it smart to keep the asymmetrical aspect of the game? The players would then seem to be stuck at a station the whole game
  * Let go of the asymmetrical part and focus more on the fun co-op aspect
* Pull players away from their station more
  * The truck has to be opened by 2 players before it unloads the products
* Layout of the level is clear. It is clear where the players have to bring products to or help customers at
* Actions that the player can do have to be visually clear
* Speed of the character is quite slow
  * Speed up the character and experiment with the movement overall more
* Make it clear for the player who is which character
  * Maybe add hats to the players to have a clear distinction
* Is A-star pathfinding too much work to add to the project?
  * Maybe give the customers a fixed path instead of the A-star
* How much do the ragdoll physics affect the gameplay
  * Take the time to test the feel of the game more
