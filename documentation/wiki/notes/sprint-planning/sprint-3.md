# Sprint 3

The planning for the third and last sprint is to do usertesting, implement this feedback and to polish the game so it will look like a complete product. The usertesting will be held in the first week of the sprint, so that this feedback can be worked on in the second week. The artists will mostly work on environmental models and UI that will make the game look more polished and complete. The developers will mostly do bug fixing as well as improving old systems that donâ€™t work that well yet.
