# Sprint 2

The planning for the second sprint is to complete the core gameplay loop. The team will also work on the improvements mentioned in the retrospective such as keeping the Trello updated. Both developers and artists will also work on the feedback we got from our customer. This was mainly completing the core gameplay and getting all the visuals implemented.
