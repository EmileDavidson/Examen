# Sprint 1

The planning fort the first sprint is to create the concept of the game and what the core of the game will be. We will also set up all the necessary tools we need to use such as: Trello, Unity and GitHub. Every idea that will be thought of will be added to a Miro board out of which we will later check what are good and what are worse ideas for the game. After confirming with the team what will be put in the game we will create userstories and put these on our Trello board. After all the userstories are create we will create ToDoâ€™s for every userstory and give these all different priorities based on how important they are to the core of the gameplay. Every morning there will be a daily standup with the team to discuss what everyone will do today and accordingly they will attach themselves to the designated ToDo that is noted on the Trello board.
