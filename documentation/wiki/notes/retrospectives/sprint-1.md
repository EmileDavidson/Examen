# Sprint 1

### Proud of:

* The product we delivered this sprint

### Went good/continue doing:

* Models were finished quickly
* Models were according to the style of the game
* Everyone worked hard

### Needs improvement:

* Not importing assets in Unity
  * Solution: Make a branch for the asset(s) and test them in the scene
* Seeing if assets fit together with the style
  * Solution: Place the asset next to other assets to see if they fit together
* Better asset naming convention
  * Solution: Do better checks for the naming of assets without the need of pull request changes
* Keep the Trello better in check
  * Solution: Checking the Trello after every standup and at the end of the day

### Stop doing:

* Sending assets/models through discord
  * Solution: Importing them in Unity and making an 'Import' branch for it
