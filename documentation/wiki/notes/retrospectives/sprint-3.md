# Sprint 3

#### Stop with:

\-        &#x20;

#### Needs improvements:

* Keeping the Trello updated
  * Adding userstories for things we donâ€™t have but are already working on

#### Went good:

* Importing assets in Unity, placing it in the correct folder with the correct naming
* &#x20; Bug fixing and implementing the feedback from usertests
* Standups every morning

#### Proud of:

* The final product we delivered
* The visuals, effects and all art that was made

#### Conclusion:

* The Trello did still not get updated regularly, but because the standups were so good the team still managed to deliver a good looking and fun to play game.
