# Commiting

{% hint style="info" %}
We know following the best practice is great, but it can be difficult and time-consuming. So, as long as the title clearly shows what is being worked on, that's good enough.
{% endhint %}

### Commit Title

The title of your commit should summarize what the change is about in a concise and descriptive manner. It should be brief, preferably no more than 50 characters. **if possible** we use imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove") if you are still working on it but want to commit it just to have a restart point you can add "WIP - {title}" and if the commit has errors you can do "UNSAFE WIP - {TITLE}"&#x20;

Good Examples:

1. Fix typo in header text
2. Add button to submit form
3. Update styling of homepage
4. Add player movement
5. Remove deprecated code&#x20;
6. WIP - Update player scripts to new input system
7. UNSAFE WIP - Update player scripts to new input system
8. Player can now move
9. You can connect multiple users

> In these good examples, you can easily see what has been worked on or what is removed, added, fixed or updated even when imperative mood was not used you can clearly see what has been worked on.

#### Bad Examples:

1. "My first commit, please don't judge me"
2. "Changed stuff"
3. "WIP commit, not ready for review"
4. "Updates and improvements"
5. "Testing something out"

> In these bad examples, the commit titles are not descriptive, concise, or written in the imperative mood. They do not provide any meaningful information about the changes made in the commit, which can make it difficult to understand the purpose of the commit without reviewing the code changes in detail.

### **Commit Description**

Although a description is not always necessary, it can be helpful to provide additional context for your commit, especially for more significant changes. In such cases, the description should expand on what was summarized in the commit title and stay focused on the specific changes you made. It is acceptable for the description to be longer than the title, but it should still be concise and only include relevant information.

In cases where there are many changes, you may consider using bullet points to summarize everything that has been modified. This can help to make the description more organized and easier to read. For small changes where the title provides sufficient information, a description may not be needed.
