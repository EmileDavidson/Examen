# Timers

Our game has a lot of timers that make the customer go to the next state or spawn over time. to handle all these things that want a timer we created the timer class!&#x20;

The timer class takes a wanted time and should be updated each update using Time.DeltaTime as a parameter. When the timer updates, the timer updated event triggers having a float as value. The float is a 0 to 1 value where 0 is not started and 1 finished.

The timer also has an onTimerFinished event that gets triggered when the timer finishes. After the timer is finished, triggering update does not work since it is finished.

This timer is great for easy and simple timers.&#x20;
