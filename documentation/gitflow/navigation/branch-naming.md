# Branch Naming

Branch naming follows a straightforward pattern, consisting of the branch type, a forward slash, and the branch name. The branch name should be entirely in lowercase letters and use dashes to separate words and clearly indicating the purpose of the branch.

Good Examples:

* feature/player-movement
* feature/main-menu
* feature/enemy-attack
* import/player-model
* import/vegetables-models
* hotfix/player-multi-jump-not-working
* hotfix/enemy-not-attacking\


Bad Examples

* player
* movement
* menu
* feature
* import/stuff
* hotfix/errors
