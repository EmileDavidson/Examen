In this section, we will detail how we managed our GitHub repository, including the conventions we followed and the steps we took for specific actions such as creating a new branch or committing our work.&#x20;

### Flow

1. Create a branch for your feature, fix or import from the develop branch
2. Do you work and commit your work frequently to prevent lost work!
3. Push your work (at least once a day at the end of your work day)
4. if you are finished with all your work create a pull request the pull request will be checked by another developer if approved it will be merged into the develop branch and this branch will be deleted. if not approved see the given change requests.
